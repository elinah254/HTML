<div class="paragraphA"> <p>Edmund Williamson wote a publication, “How to counsel students” and came up with six sequential steps to career guidance and counseling. These steps are analysis, synthesis, diagnosis, prognosis, counseling and follow up. These steps can be of much help to a teacher counselor in as high school while offering career guidance to the students. The steps and their applications in a high school have been discussed below <p>
	</div>

<p>Williamson Edmund identifies analysis as the first step in career guidance. The counselor in this stage is supposed to collect all the necessary data or relevant information  about the client. The counselor tries to know more about the client’s background, attitude,  personality,  family members, skills, education, work history and self-interest. The counselor can get to know all these information by looking at the records kept. The counselor can also get information about the client by talking to the parents, friends and relatives of the client.<p>
	

 <div id="paragraphB"> <p>Follow up is the last stage of career guidance according to Williamson Edmund. Follow-up in counseling is  a stage of treatment that comes after the successful completion of all the other steps of counseling and the action plan has been taken. The counselor provides ongoing assistance including encouraging and giving positive reinforcement  to help the client to adjust to the chosen career. This helps the client to feel like they belong and that someone is there to hold their hand incase of anything.
	
</p>

   <p>Edmund<b> Williamson talks about counseling, as the second last stage of career counseling</b>. According to him, the counselor owns the entire responsibility for solving problems and helping the client to come up with the best decision ever. The counselor is supposed to explore  the problem brought by the client, define it, diagnose it and most important, help the client to come up with solutions or to prevent the problem from happening. The counselor is supposed to make sure that the client makes a sober decision.
